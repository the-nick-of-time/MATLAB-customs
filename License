I don't want to be legalistic here, but there are a few points to clear up.

1.  This code is not guaranteed at all, in any way whatsoever. If it doesn't work, fix it yourself or report specific bugs to me.
2.  You are free to use and modify this code any way you want. 
3.  The code is absolutely free to download and always will be.
4.  Despite this, if you manage to somehow commercialize this, good on you? I guess? I'm not going to sue you or anything.
5.  As long as you use the unmodified code, you must credit me. As soon as you change some functionality, the code is yours to do with as you will (this prevents Ship of Theseus problems). At that point I will not require credit, but your professor may.
